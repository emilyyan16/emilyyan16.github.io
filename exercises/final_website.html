                <p>This piece is a redesign I created for the spire landing page.
                    The umass SPIRE is long overdue for a redesign. The current site is clunky and difficult to navigate.
                    I wanted to create a more user friendly experience for students. I used a color palette that is more in line with the UMass brand and made the site more visually appealing. I also added a search bar to make it easier for students to find what they are looking for. I hope you enjoy this redesign!

                <p>This piece is a design I created for a tea brand called Twisted Mint.
                    I wanted to create a design that was fun and playful, while still being elegant and sophisticated. I used a color palette that is bright and cheerful, and I incorporated a mint leaf into the design to give it a fresh feel. I hope you enjoy this design!

                    <p>This last piece is a typographic art. It's what's referred to as a 
                        6 word short story. The goal is to tell a story in 6 words or less. I wanted to create something that was simple and elegant, while still being impactful. I incorporated a simple font to give it a clean look. I hope you enjoy this piece!
                        It reads as follows: "Ring available: death did us part."  I wanted to create something that was both beautiful and heartbreaking, and I hope I achieved that with this piece.
